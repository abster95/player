- window add screen position enums like popover, unify? how?
- windows
  - unite with UI
  - clean up serialization
- mood picker finish up
- current item / metadata

- reading metadata of sel items degrades perf of table in sel/move operations

- context menus circular labels' position off
- widget transfer defaulting w settings
- widg man  prefFactory per group configs -> getWidget reimplement
- Player update item not refreshing selected pl item

- shortcuts '~', '\' and other weird ones                                       (major)
- continuous shortcut (on key pressed rather than released)
- shortcuts global or local settnigs
- shortcuts solve 500ms lag
- writeException - suspend playback (phew)                                      (medium)
- thumbnail border still screwing around (file info resizing)

- notification Text > Other unify add show(title, text, cover)
- app stealing focus on play next pop                                           (still an issue ?)
- splitter absolute size for both children
- context menus unify with popups                                               (?)
- popup wrong coord init (+notifications border gap diff for each side...)
- popup open = events not propagating                                           (what exactly is this)
- rater controls make resizable - part of a bigger problem, its more that the
  graphics dont resize, though the component itself does
- splitter positions keep getting fucked up on consequent resizes
- playback states - change, suspend, etc - perfect + cleanup
- playlist table sorting programatically (by styles)
- playlist table header button implement properly column hiding (nasty bug)
- realTime serialize

------------------------------------------------------
--------------------FUNCTIONALITY---------------------
------------------------------------------------------

- CHAPTERS   TAG | XML OPTION
- widget manager widget
- configuration lookup all classes with annotated fields for config (avoid
    manual registering)
- cursor effects API
- cursor effect to popup, get rid of effectPane
- tagger disable unsupported fields for type
- tagger multithreaded writing to tag
- getNext/Prev in PlaylistManager + random pick

- tagger filename change                                                        (?)

FURTHER DOWN THE LIST FUNCTIONALITIES
- even more flexibly resizable widget areas
- cover downloading widget
- general table object
    non editable
    generate from POJO
    read database records
    sorting, filtering, header, columns visibility, order
    columns relative size
    remember state
-- color support, color graph of all songs would kill
- monitor folder content for changes (playlists, layouts, skins, widgets, ...)

- metadata reading flac, ogg (most are already done)
- metadata writing
    flac (most are already done)
    ogg  (most are already done)
- playback ogg, flac
- URL source support + playback, related stuff

VISUALISATION
- control panel (play, pause, stop)
- add more settings
- add pluggable new visualisations
- support pluggable visualization individual configuration

APP
- tray                                                                          (extend awt & swing ?)
- OS taskbar, ... support
- associate with supported files
- icon

IMAGE VIEWER
- show subfolder names and categorize images                                    (?)
- add multiple sources (tag, cds, folder, 'associated') and separate
- reset counter when manual picture change                                      (minor)

GALAXY MAP
- just about everything
- enum like every field...
- map type representants: x, y, z, color, label, shape, ...

------------------------------------------------------
------------------------BUGS--------------------------
------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL
- rating not initialized visually on reload                                     (medium)
- table empty rows flickering (when run from netbeans it doesnt happen)         (minor)
- deselecting single items with CTRL not working sometimes                      (medium)
- Enviroment Dektop.browse() doesnt select files in explorer but opens them     (unsolvable?)
- little bug with position slider on repositioning                              (minor)
- table playlist: moving items wont change tables' own selection                (medium but nasty)

// unsolvable
- reading metadata COMMENT tag field incorrectly reads CUSTOM1 if present
  workaround: custom comment reading method filters out CUSTOM fields

------------------------------------------------------
------------------------CODE--------------------------
------------------------------------------------------

CLEANUP
- get rid of ROW_HEIGHT and find out how to get row heigh dynamically           (solved with FixedCellSize ?)
- clean ExtendedInfo widget - its completely fubar
- Serializator and serialization code clean up
- metadata caching playlist-selected
- widget info get,init simplify to without w load
- skin trait clean up
  trait install/uninstall add static method for dynamic objects

API
Layouts---------
- BiContainer nonpure version works only as pure. Its abstract to avoid misuse
- add parametrization and decoupling of gui-type from contatiers. Generics will
  not help here unfortunately. With type erasure its looking poorly.
- Layouter not part of Layout map. The reason is simple - if it would be, it
  would get wrapped in widgetarea. But other than that, its proving more trouble
  than its worth. Particularly because the Container.indexOf(Layouter) doesnt
  work as it returns null (since its not part of the layout map). Maybe widgets
  could have inherent property of needing Area wrapper, Layout would not.
  UniContainer needs to be reworked then.
- separate and implement Pure vs Leaf Containers better

POPUPS
- popover positioning autofix gets in the way - make it compatible, reimplement (set to false if positioning needs to work correctly)
- popover animation in/out implement properly, allow interpolators
- popover moving with app listeners badly implemented, reimplement
- popover moving with app not working for all show() methods! make def behavior
- popover show() methods way too much mess...

UNIFICATIONS, OVERHAULS, REDESIGN
- unify chapters and infos into singular type of field allowing multiple values
- playing item, metadata, ... in Playbackmanager, clear Player class
- Configuration unite Action and other types of Config

IMPROVEMENTS
- file format discovery. Unite Image and Audio types add category               (minor, although much needed for robustness)
- gui traits add uninstall, put into setters, remove from constructors          (minor, but very desirable and very doable)
- playlist selected items make unmodifiable
- decouple Playlist and Serializable playlist
- moving items in playlist - redo the algorithm for by>|1|                      (minor)
- playlist table drag code duplication
- playlist table highlight playing apply css item columFactory > rowFactory


PERFORMANCE
- closing widgets not releasing memory                                          (still an issue ?)
- onTimeAt events seem to be pretty power hungry(4x=10MB), implement clock to
  cut down number of cycles (200ms should be MORE than enough)
- played files leak on song change                                              (?)
- improve pictures (even more)
- images loading on separate thread (possibly imageLoader class?)               (?)
- invisible widgets - suspend

------------------------------------------------------
---------------------- TESTING -----------------------
------------------------------------------------------

- writing tag - multiple values
- Layout loading into Container
