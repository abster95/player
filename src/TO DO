------------------------------------------------------
------------------------BUGS--------------------------
------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL
- playlsitTable sometimes bugs out during scrolling or forgets to update        (minor, investigate)
- rating not initialized visually on reload                                     (medium)
- deselecting single items with CTRL not working sometimes                      (medium)
- Enviroment Dektop.browse() doesnt select files in explorer but opens them     (unsolvable?)
- little bug with position slider on repositioning                              (minor)
- Text Node doesnt get skinned by css. No idea why, but its very inconvenient.  (medium)
  (+- workaround: set font color manually <- only css knows the color!)
- table doesnt show playing item after manual gui refresh                       (minor)
- playlist item moving change order when moving fast even for jsut 1 block      (medium-major, investigate)

SOLVED (with unwanted workaround)
(it means the bug presents no misbehavior but the root problem still deserves
 attention)
- reading metadata COMMENT tag field incorrectly reads CUSTOM1 if present       (minor)
  workaround: custom comment reading method filters out CUSTOM fields
  problem: carries potential risk of causing additional tagging problems
- split container divider position doesnt load properly (vertical only).        (medium)
  This has something to do with some other (probably orientation) property
  overriding divider position and consequently changing the "pos" value in the
  very container ultimately losing the original position value
  workaround: change container "pos" value only when divider position changes as
  a result of mouse dragging.
  problem: performance aspect. There is possibility of infinite recursive call
  for setting divider position. Plus the setPosition is now called multiple
  times depending on depth within layout map possibly with O(n) or worse. This
  is because of the recursive nature of layout map loading where children are
  loaded before parent, causing additional resize pass for every depth iteration
  when the parent loads. This is possibly worse than O(3^x)!
  solution: the layout map shouldnt load recursively. This has potential to
  get rid of major resizing bugs on layout init (like thumbnails and custom
  layouts).
- Item if corrupted getLocation still works! set it to empty path               (minor, technicality...)
  getLocation causing a weird problem if item.getFile() doesnt return abs file  (not a problem)

------------------------------------------------------
------------------------CODE--------------------------
------------------------------------------------------

CLEANUP
- get rid of ROW_HEIGHT and find out how to get row heigh dynamically, also
  set proper padding for table rows and get away with fixedRowSize in playlist
  table FRS doesnt solve this problem as it breaks skins
- clean ExtendedInfo widget - its completely fubar
- Serializator and serialization code clean up
- metadata caching playlist-selected
- widget info get,init simplify to without w load
- skin trait clean up
  trait install/uninstall add static method for dynamic objects

API
Layouts---------
- BiContainer nonpure version works only as pure. Its abstract to avoid misuse
- add parametrization and decoupling of gui-type from containers. Generics will
  not help here unfortunately. With type erasure its looking poorly.
- Layouter not part of Layout map. The reason is simple - if it would be, it
  would get wrapped in widgetarea. But other than that, its proving more trouble
  than its worth. Particularly because the Container.indexOf(Layouter) doesnt
  work as it returns null (since its not part of the layout map). Maybe widgets
  could have inherent property of needing Area wrapper, val for Layouter false.
  UniContainer needs to be reworked then.
- separate and implement Pure vs Leaf Containers better

POPUPS
- popover positioning autofix gets in the way - make it compatible, reimplement (set to false if positioning needs to work correctly)
- popover animation in/out implement properly, allow interpolators
- popover moving with app listeners badly implemented, reimplement
- popover moving with app not working for all show() methods! make def behavior
- popover show() methods way too much mess...

UNIFICATIONS, OVERHAULS, REDESIGN
- unify chapters and infos into singular type of field allowing multiple values
- playing item, metadata, ... in Playbackmanager, clear Player class
- Configuration unite Action and other types of Config

IMPROVEMENTS
- file format discovery. Unite Image and Audio types add category               (minor, although much needed for robustness)
- gui traits add uninstall, put into setters, remove from constructors          (minor, but very desirable and very doable)
- decouple Playlist and Serializable playlist
- moving items in playlist - redo the algorithm for by>|1|                      (minor)
- playlist table drag code duplication

PERFORMANCE
- closing widgets not releasing memory                                          (still an issue ?)
- onTimeAt events seem to be pretty power hungry(4x=10MB), implement clock to
  cut down number of cycles (200ms should be MORE than enough)
- played files leak on song change                                              (?)
- improve pictures (even more)
- images loading on separate thread (possibly imageLoader class?)               (?)
- invisible widgets - suspend
- picker static always in memory mem leak                                       (minor)
  problem: how to lazy load it if not as static field?
- layout reload mem leak - investigate, weakListeners+OnClosing should help

------------------------------------------------------
--------- "PERKS" & WHAT ONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT -------
------------------------------------------------------

- when operating with playlist, the items must not be cloned or copied in a way
  then creates new item instance. Playlist's behavior is applicable on the
  very instances of the items it contains. Methods such as removeItems(items) or
  isPlaying() will not work for items not contained in the playlist correctly.
  Even two different playlist tables withing GUI, in case they are linked to one
  playlist) share the same instances.
- playlist table row height is fixed for now
- scrollbar width should be 15px. Or table resize might break.


------------------------------------------------------
---------------------- TESTING -----------------------
------------------------------------------------------

- writing tag - multiple values
- Layout loading into Container

------------------------------------------------------
------------------ HOW TO USE TIPS -------------------
------------------------------------------------------

- clicking on table columns sorts ASC/DESC/ORIG, holding SHIFT to sort by
  multiple columns
