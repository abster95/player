player
======

info:

JavaFX based audio player application.
Application's main focus is on modularity of the graphical user interface (GUI) and its customizability. Indivindual
functionalities are represented by widgets that can be used anywhere within layout.

Below are screenshots of current looks with different (still incomplete) skins:

repository: 

At the moment, this repository is for tight circle of people interested in the project's development. It is not
for sharing so far incomplete code of the application. Please bear this in mind and dont openly distirbute, provide or publicize this project without prior agreement until the project reaches viable state.

You are free to make your own builds for satisfying curiosity and digging into the code and the workings of the
project as well as use the built application.



project:

Currently under development.
The application is in early and experimental stage, unfit of being heavily used. It is currently being readied for
use and collaborative development.
- its still in early development stages
- lots of functionalities are incomplete, bugged, dysfunctional, undocumented or simply not intuitive.
- lots of functionalities are plain experimental or for educational or testing purposes
In case you are (still) interested in the project in any way or in contribution (always welcome), you can notify me by mail.



building & use:

Currently, there is no executable for download as it requires proper documentation of the features and guide for use. Coming soon.

The provided files are
- source files
- working directory containing application data.
- libraries

In order to properly build and run the application the working folder should be set up in the project's settings in the IDE.
The included libraries must be included in the project.
To develop the widgets included and located in the working directory, add the working_dir/Widgets directory as a source
location for source code in the project properties. It is not necessary to build and run the application.

Proper manuals and HOWTOs will be provided later.



dependencies & external code & licences:

The list of dependencies such as libraries and other useful information in this regard will be provided later
(hopefully soon).

The project makes use of work of sevaral other individuals, who will be properly credited later as well.

The project is set to adopt MIT licence in the future, but for now remains personal. I would appreciate to be
informed before taking any actions that could result in publicizing, sharing or building upon this project.
