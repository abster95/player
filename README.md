======

info:

JavaFX based audio player application.
Application's main focus is on modularity of the graphical user interface (GUI) and its customizability. Indivindual
functionalities are represented by widgets that can be used anywhere within layout.

Below are screenshots of current looks with different (still incomplete) skins:

use:

To run the application download the zip and run the Player.jar file in the /executable directory. It will open the application with clear layout.
To customize layout, mouse over the empty area and chose the container. Placing mouse in the top right corner of the container will display options for example menu button for widget selection ( the "o" button). Holding ALT key will turn on layout mode and show layout handling controls.
Tip: Mouse over the controls to display tooltips. Buttons and controls generally have tooltips explaining their functionality.

Proper manuals and HOWTOs will be provided later.



repository: 

At the moment, this repository is for tight circle of people interested in the project's development. It is not
for sharing so far incomplete code of the application. Please bear this in mind and dont openly distirbute, provide or publicize this project without prior agreement until the project reaches viable state.

You are free to make your own builds for satisfying curiosity and digging into the code and the workings of the
project as well as use the built application.



project:

Currently under development.
The application is in early and experimental stage, unfit of being heavily used. It is currently being readied for
use and collaborative development.
- its still in early development stages
- lots of functionalities are incomplete, bugged, dysfunctional, undocumented or simply not intuitive.
- lots of functionalities are plain experimental or for educational or testing purposes
In case you are (still) interested in the project in any way or in contribution (always welcome), you can notify me by mail.



building project:


The provided files are
- source files
- working directory containing application data.
- libraries

In order to properly build and run the application the working folder should be set up in the project's settings in the IDE.
The included libraries must be included in the project.
To develop the widgets included and located in the working directory, add the working_dir/Widgets directory as a source
location for source code in the project properties. It is not necessary to build and run the application.

Proper manuals and HOWTOs will be provided later.
