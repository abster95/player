- widg man  prefFactory per group configs -> getWidget reimplement
- playlist table text orientation messed up
- Player update item not refreshing selected pl item
- default skin remove dependency on Caspian
- image viewer reset counter when manual picture change
- shortcuts ~ and other weird ones
- continuous shortcut (on key pressed rather than released)
- shortcuts solve 500ms lag
- writeException - suspend playback (phew)                                      (medium)
- thumbnail border still fucking around (file info resizing)
- tagger filename change                                                        (?)

- notification Text > Other unify  add show(title, text, cover)

- app stealing focus on play next pop 
- splitter absolute size for both children
- context menus unify with popups                                               (?)
- popup wrong coord init (+notifications border gap diff for each side...)
- popup open = events not propagating
- rater controls make resizable - part of a bigger problem, its more that the
  graphics dont resize, though the component itself does.

- Layout loading into Container nullpointer (stackoverflow)

- splitter positions keep getting fucked up on consequent resizes
- playback states - change, suspend, etc - perfect + cleanup
- playlist table - attempt to resize columns to computedSize and remove width
  binding
- playlist table header bad init header size
- playlist table sorting programatically (by styles)
- playlist table drag code duplication
- realTime
- 2 playlists at once - table selection F'd up
- table playlist: moving items wont change tables' own selection test with SHIT (medium but nasty)

------------------------------------------------------
--------------------FUNCTIONALITY---------------------
------------------------------------------------------

- CHAPTERS   TAG | XML OPTION
- widget manager widget
- configuration lookup all classes with annotated fields for config (avoid
  manual registering)
- cursor effects API
- cursor effect to popup, get rid of effectPane
- tagger disable unsupported fields for type
- tagger multithreaded writing to tag
- getNext/Prev in PlaylistManager + random pick
- externalize gui controls
- mini player controls dock
- playlist tabs
- import/export some of the most used playlist file formats
- save playlist selected items as playlist
- shuffle play order

- extended circle context menu to allow multiple contents

FURTHER DOWN THE LIST FUNCTIONALITIES
- freeformContainer                                                             (?)
- cover downloading widget
- general table object
  - non editable
  - generate from POJO
  - read database records
  - sorting, filtering, header, columns visibility, order
  - columns relative size
  - remember state
- thin mode (thin dockable micro-gui on top of the screen)
- color to song, 32bit rgb with color picker  (gonna be awesome)r
- song color association (metadata, extended metadata or sth)
- galaxy map
-- color support, color graph of all songs would kill
- monitor folder content for changes (playlists, layouts, skins, widgets, ...)
- visualization
- metadata reading
    flac (most are already done)
    ogg  (most are already done)
- metadata writing
    flac (most are already done)
    ogg  (most are already done)
- playback ogg, flac
- URL source support + playback, related stuff

APP
- tray                                                                          (extend awt & swing ?)

IMAGE VIEWER
- support parent folder for multiple cds in album etc...
- show subfolder names and categorize images
- add multiple sources support (tag, folder, 'associated')
  separate sources into own TilePanes with names

------------------------------------------------------
------------------------BUGS--------------------------
------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL
- rating not initialized visually on reload                                     (medium)
- removing widgets on tab close not working                                     (major)
- table empty rows flickering (when run from netbeans it doesnt happen)         (minor)
- deselecting single items with CTRL not working sometimes                      (medium)
- Enviroment Dektop.browse() doesnt select files in explorer but opens them     (unsolvable?)
- little bug with position slider on repositioning (need to identify source of  (minor)
  the prob)
- skinning doesnt get applied to some components (movable window,...)           (medium)

SKINNING
- unable to skin combobox

------------------------------------------------------
------------------------CODE--------------------------
------------------------------------------------------

CLEANUP
- get rid of ROW_HEIGHT and find out how to get row heigh dynamically           (solved with FixedCellSize ?)
- clean ExtendedInfo widget - its completely fubar
- Serializator and serialization code clean up
- metadata caching playlist-selected
- widget info get,init simplify to without w load
- skin trait clean up
  trait install/uninstall add static method for dynamic objects

UNIFICATIONS, OVERHAULS, REDESIGN
- unify chapters and infos into singular type of field allowing multiple values
- playing item, metadata, ... in Playbackmanager, clear Player class
- MovableWidow, floating windows, etc... -> popups, support multiplicity and
  implement layout/window management, play aroudn with modality, etc...

IMPROVEMENTS
- file format discovery. Unite Image and Audio types add category               (minor, although much needed for robustness)
- gui traits add uninstall, put into setters, remove from constructors          (minor, but very desirable and very doable)
- metadata failure null etc, make Reader classs                                 (?)
- playlist selected items make unmodifiable
- decouple Playlist and Serializable playlist
- moving items in playlist - redo the algorithm for by>|1|                      (minor)


PERFORMANCE
- skin change | more intensive graphical loading deteorizes perf severely       (medium)
- default skin causes low performance
- closing widgets not releasing memory
- onTimeAt events seem to be pretty power hungry(4x=10MB), implement clock to
  cut down number of cycles (200ms should be MORE than enough)
- played files leak on song change                                              (?)
- improve pictures (even more)
- images loading on separate thread (possibly imageLoader class?)               (?)
- click effect mem leak, pool + if possible up the performance in trail mode

------------------------------------------------------
---------------------- TESTING -----------------------
------------------------------------------------------

- writing tag - multiple artists


------------------------------------------------------
-------------------- DEPLOYMENT ----------------------
------------------------------------------------------

- make webstart wokr
- make in broswer work
- implement application versioning
